# Kruskal's Algorithm in C++

This is a C++ implementation of **Kruskal's Algorithm** for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph.

## Files
- `kruskal.cpp`: The main implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm.
- `makefile`: A Makefile to easily compile and clean the project.

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

## Compilation
To compile the project, simply run:
```bash
make
```

This will create an executable named `kruskal`.

## Cleanup
To remove the compiled files and clean the project directory, run:
```bash
make clean
```

## Usage
1. Compile the project using `make`.
2. Run the program with:
```bash
./kruskal
```

### Example Input
You will be prompted to input the number of edges, followed by the edges (with weights).

### Example Output
The program will display the edges of the MST.
